    Sensei "I see… I wasn’t expecting such a straightforward answer from you Akari-san."

    Sensei "Well, considering how kind you are, I’m willing to give you another chance."
    Akari "Really?"
    Sensei "Yes, let me explain. The biggest contributor to you failing the class were the exams you just took now. If you had passed, there wouldn't have been any problems, but that didn’t happen, did it now?" 
    Sensei "That’s why, I’m willing to let you retake the exams. However, as of now, if you retake the exams, do you think you have the ability to pass?"
